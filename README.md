# Logistic-Regression-MultiDataset-Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes how the performance of a single Machine Learning algorithm changes across different datasets.

The same algorithm — **Logistic Regression** — is applied to multiple real-world datasets to study how dataset characteristics influence prediction accuracy.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Apply one ML algorithm to multiple datasets
- Compare model performance
- Understand dataset suitability for Logistic Regression
